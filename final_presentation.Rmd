## Introduction

For this project we merged data from two main sources: John Hopkins and Gapminder.

<div class="columns-2">
### John Hopkins data - [Repository Link](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19)

- Main datasets of the project
  - Time series of COVID-19 confirmed cases
  - Time series of COVID-19 deaths
  - Population count (IUD)
  


### Gapminder data - [Website Link](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)

- 18 datasets of varying relevance including:  
  - Life expectancy
  - Smoking and Alcohol Consumption
  - Body Mass Index and Basic Sanitation

## Introduction
COVID-19 has impacted differently in different countries and the reasons why this has been the case are still under investigation.

</center>
In our project we aim to analyze a set of variables affecting mostly all countries to elucidate which may be the factors affecting COVID-19 outbreak.

</center>
To do this we performed an exploratory analysis using different datasets

## Methods

![Worflow chart](presentation-figure/Workflow.png){height=400}



## Methods
For the time series datasets we selected the Country/Region column and the number of cases reported the 29th April 2021.

The same procedure was appliad to dataset 02.
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}

data01_pres <- read_tsv(file = "data/01_JH_01CovidCases.tsv")
```
```{r, echo = FALSE}
data01_pres
```

## Methods
For the rest of datasets we selected the country column and the most recent data (data from the last year registered).
```{r, echo = FALSE}
data06_raw <- read.csv(file = "data/_raw/06_Gap_smoking_adults_percent_of_population_over_age_15.csv")
data06_raw <- data06_raw  %>% 
  select(country, X2005) %>% 
  rename(Smoking = X2005)
data06_raw
```
Similar procedure for datasets 04 to 24.


## Methods

Then we grouped by country and sum the cases in the different regions of the same country.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
data01 <- data01_pres %>%
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  summarise_all(sum)
data01
```


## Methods


### Main cleaning tasks

- Join John Hopkins data by Country column
- Join Gapminder data by Country column
- Remove NA in Gapminder data by replacing by the mean
- Fix country names so they look the same in both datasets
- Join both datasets





## Methods
We added the following new attributes to the dataset:


- Cases per 100000 inhabitants: $\frac{Cases}{Population}100000$
- Deaths per 100000 inhabitants: $\frac{Deaths}{Population}100000$
- Fatality rate: $\frac{Deaths}{Cases}100$
- Population density: $\frac{Population}{Area}$
- Fatality class
  - Low fatality
  - High fatality
- BMI class for both genders

## Methods
```{r, echo=FALSE, message = FALSE}
library("patchwork")
data_clean_aug <- read_tsv(file = "data/03_analysis_1_clean_aug.tsv")
data_clean_aug
```

## Modelling


### 4 different y variables
  -	Cases per 100k persons, Deaths per 100k persons, Fatality rate (Deaths/Cases), Positive rate (Cases/Tests)



### 19 different x variables:
  -	Continent, % of urban population, % of smoking adults, blood pressure, Cholesterol levels, BMI, etc.

For each of the y variables we fitted a linear model without any interaction terms. Because we had categorical variables, we then a ancova to identify the significant attributes (alpha=0.05).


## Data analysis
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
ancova_pvalues_data <- read_tsv(file = "results/Ancova_pvalues.tsv")
ancova_pvalues_data
```

## Conclusions

We have seen that some variables have an effect in the COVID-19 outbreak:

<center>

![](presentation-figure/flecha.png){height=40}

</center>

It seems that the number of cases and deaths are not really informative about the situation in some countries because the testing rate differs among them.
<center>

![](presentation-figure/flecha.png){height=40}

</center>

Even when including the testing rate in our analysis it seems that the way this procedure is performed among the countries is very different and that differences should also be taken into account in future analyses (look into metadata about how the testing is carried out in the different countries)
